		<Command cmd="camera.jumpto Mercury" delay="19000" text="Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun of 87.97 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods." sound="mercury_clip"/>
		<Command cmd="camera.jumpto Venus" delay="29000" text="Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets (meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east). It does not have any natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty." sound="venus_clip"/>
		<Command cmd="camera.jumpto Earth" delay="37000" text="Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times" sound="earth_clip"/>
		<Command cmd="camera.jumpto Mars" delay="34000" text="Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth." sound="mars_clip"/>

		<Command cmd='camera.jumpto bookmark "Ground in Seattle"' delay="19000" text="Hey everyone welcome to the Planetarium, In here we can see stars and all of the planets. Hey, I have a question for you. How many Planets are there? Eight, nine, eleven, a hundred? What if I told you that you all are right? So what is a planet anyway?" sound=""/>
		<Command cmd="system.setsimulatedtimevelocity 600" delay="29000" text="When we go outside at night we can see all these points of light in the sky. Now, do any of you see a giant bear walking across the sky? To be honest with you I can’t. I try, I really do but I just can’t see it. But let me tell you something, one thing I like to do is read books. Does anyone here like to read? I also, I admit it, I like to watch TV sometimes and I like to watch movies too. But imagine yourself in a time before television, in a time before movies even in a time before books" sound=""/>
		<Command cmd="constellations.on" offcmd="constellations.on" delay="37000" text="When all there was a storyteller and the night sky. Then you can start to see great bears walking across the sky and great warriors fighting bulls. For 200,000 years humans have been looking at the night sky, telling stories and seeing patterns. Those patterns were important because we learned they would tell us when to plant our crops or when to go hunting. And of all those tiny points of light in the night sky there were five that were different, let me show you." sound=""/>
		<Command cmd="camera.jumpto Mars" delay="34000" text="I’m going to jump us ahead in time to later this year, to October when two of those lights will be very impressive in the eastern sky. Can you see them?" sound=""/>
